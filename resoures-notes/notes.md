Google Maps Platform Overview

Adding a Google Map with a Marker to Your Website

Created my map.html, but getting a failed to compile error message

Failed to compile ./src/App.js Module not found: Can't resolve './components/map.html' in 'C:\Users\thene\Google Drive\GWG phase 2\GWGprojects\myneighborhood-maps\src' This error occurred during the build time and cannot be dismissed.

Gonna try and get a map going outside of this project, just to get the map to render, than i will copy and paste into this project

##Slack notes thenewmona {FEND}Michigan [Today at 7:44 AM] good morning everyone working on P7, and of course having issues right out of the gate Don't think I have ever seen this one before in the Slack or forums

I am trying to build my map I actually started in my project following Brad Traversy's video, but since he is not doing in REACT, I decided to just start totally separate, learn how to do it, and them copy it in my project

All I have is an HTML file as you can see in my screenshot, but somewhere it is pulling my swDB.js file , or at least that is what the console is showing.

I have no idea where this coming from. I did a hard cache reload, thinking it is cached from my restaurant app Anyone have this issue before or seen this issue before

Thanks

8 replies Asmaa [7 minutes ago] did you try window.google.map.Map

Asmaa [6 minutes ago] like this const map = new window.google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map")

Asmaa [5 minutes ago] also do you have your height like this height: 100vh;

Also sent to the channel thenewmona {FEND}Michigan [4 minutes ago] @Asmaa actually I am just following a tutorial right now, and it is just a plain HTML file, I have no JS , no folders, or anything I can not for the life of me figure out where this JS error's are coming from.

thenewmona {FEND}Michigan [3 minutes ago] But where is the swDB.js file coming from in the very first line That is what I am trying to figure out

thenewmona {FEND}Michigan [< 1 minute ago] and of course it is now time for me to get ready and go to work. Thanks for looking @Asmaa I will be back at tonight again Gonna get this map working tonight Have a great day

Asmaa [< 1 minute ago] oh i was looking at the typeerror the undefined map that all you got to do is add window in front of google.maps.Map,

12/3/2018 Finally figured out how to get rid of the service worker issue had to unregister the SW, and clear my local storage I have a map, with an icon and infoWindow thanks to Brad Traversy

getBounds()
Parameters:  None
Return Value:  LatLngBounds
Returns the lat/lng bounds of the current viewport. If more than one copy of the world is visible, the bounds range in longitude from -180 to 180 degrees inclusive. If the map is not yet initialized (i.e. the mapType is still null), or center and zoom have not been set then the result is null or undefined.
