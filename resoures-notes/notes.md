Google Maps Platform Overview

Adding a Google Map with a Marker to Your Website

Created my map.html, but getting a failed to compile error message

Failed to compile ./src/App.js Module not found: Can't resolve './components/map.html' in 'C:\Users\thene\Google Drive\GWG phase 2\GWGprojects\myneighborhood-maps\src' This error occurred during the build time and cannot be dismissed.

Gonna try and get a map going outside of this project, just to get the map to render, than i will copy and paste into this project

##Slack notes thenewmona {FEND}Michigan [Today at 7:44 AM] good morning everyone working on P7, and of course having issues right out of the gate Don't think I have ever seen this one before in the Slack or forums

I am trying to build my map I actually started in my project following Brad Traversy's video, but since he is not doing in REACT, I decided to just start totally separate, learn how to do it, and them copy it in my project

All I have is an HTML file as you can see in my screenshot, but somewhere it is pulling my swDB.js file , or at least that is what the console is showing.

I have no idea where this coming from. I did a hard cache reload, thinking it is cached from my restaurant app Anyone have this issue before or seen this issue before

Thanks

8 replies Asmaa [7 minutes ago] did you try window.google.map.Map

Asmaa [6 minutes ago] like this const map = new window.google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map")

Asmaa [5 minutes ago] also do you have your height like this height: 100vh;

Also sent to the channel thenewmona {FEND}Michigan [4 minutes ago] @Asmaa actually I am just following a tutorial right now, and it is just a plain HTML file, I have no JS , no folders, or anything I can not for the life of me figure out where this JS error's are coming from.

thenewmona {FEND}Michigan [3 minutes ago] But where is the swDB.js file coming from in the very first line That is what I am trying to figure out

thenewmona {FEND}Michigan [< 1 minute ago] and of course it is now time for me to get ready and go to work. Thanks for looking @Asmaa I will be back at tonight again Gonna get this map working tonight Have a great day

Asmaa [< 1 minute ago] oh i was looking at the typeerror the undefined map that all you got to do is add window in front of google.maps.Map,

12/3/2018 Finally figured out how to get rid of the service worker issue had to unregister the SW, and clear my local storage I have a map, with an icon and infoWindow thanks to Brad Traversy

12/5/2018

finishing up vanilla version of my map

12/6/2018

  render() {
    return <"/>;
  }
}`
